Description: Research compendium documenting data visualisation and generalised
            additive model (GAM) fitting for the spatiotemporal dynamics of
            chickpea Ascochyta blight spread in the paddock from research
            studies conducted in Queensland, AU during the 2020 winter 
            cropping season.
