# Spatiotemporal dynamics of Ascochyta blight in chickpea

The goal of of this project is to investigate the spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight from primary infection foci, and to investigate the key environmental factors influencing disease progress in space and time. 

A user-friendly website of this research compendium is available here, <https://ihsankhaliq.github.io/spatiotemporaldynamics/>.
Interested parties may wish to view the data analysis and visualisation pipeline as well as model fitting, these are available under the "Articles" menu item of the [web page](https://ihsankhaliq.github.io/spatiotemporaldynamics/).

## Reproducibility and data availability

This analysis is packaged and fully reproducible. All data from this work are included in this repository and R package in the "inst/extdata" folder. The code used in the statistical analyses and data visualisation is available to run in R Markdown vignettes, including extra instruction for which we did not have space in the paper. The also archived and documented with Zenodo,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4563709, for reuse

## Abstract

Ascochyta blight epidemics have been observed in many countries since the early 1900s but studies on an interaction between the amount of inoculum, environmental factors and the spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight are rare due to the historic emphasis on developing resistant cultivars and chemical control of the disease. We used generalised additive models to investigate key environmental factors affecting the spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight from primary infection foci. Briefly, four replicate plots (20 m x 20 m) of a susceptible chickpea cultivar were planted at two different locations, Billa Billa and Tosari, Queenslad Australia. Four naturally infested stubble pieces were placed at the centre of each newly emerged chickpea plot 14 days after sowing. Disease incidence were recorded at the distances of 3, 6 and 9 m in a concentric arrangement around the primary infection foci. Disease incidence increased with each assessment date approaching 100% disease incidence at the time of final assessment. The rate of disease progress was faster at Tosari. The rate of disease progress significantly decreased as the distance from the primary infection foci increased. Of the different environmental factors affecting Ascochyta blight development, rainfall had the most prominent effect. The effect of average relative humidity and wind speed was found to be non-significant, whereas temperature had a significant effect for Billa Billa only. The finding that single infection foci were enough to spread disease across whole plots indicate that limited inoculum is not a barrier in the development of an epiphytotic under conducive conditions.
