# Spatiotemporal dynamics of Ascochyta blight in chickpea

The goal of of this project is to investigate the spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight from primary infection foci, and to investigate the key environmental factors influencing disease progress in space and time. 

A user-friendly website of this research compendium is available here, <https://ihsankhaliq.github.io/spatiotemporaldynamics/>.
Interested parties may wish to view the data analysis and visualisation pipeline as well as model fitting, these are available under the "Articles" menu item of the [web page](https://ihsankhaliq.github.io/spatiotemporaldynamics/).

## Reproducibility and data availability

This analysis is packaged and fully reproducible. All data from this work are included in this repository and R package in the "inst/extdata" folder. The code used in the statistical analyses and data visualisation is available to run in R Markdown vignettes, including extra instruction for which we did not have space in the paper. These are also archived and documented with Zenodo,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4563709, for reuse
