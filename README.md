# Spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight in chickpea from primary infection foci: insights from plant, pathogen and the environment interactions to inform an epidemic risk

The goal of of this project is to investigate the spatiotemporal development of Ascochyta blight from primary infection foci, and to investigate the key environmental factors influencing disease progress in space and time. 

The published paper is available from the European Journal of Plant Pathology https://doi.org/10.1007/s10658-021-02324-6


## Abstract 

Ascochyta rabiei asexual spores (conidia) were assumed to spread over short distances (~10 m) in combination of rain and strong wind. We investigated the potential distance of conidial spread in three rainfall and three sprinkler irrigation events. Chickpea trap plants were distributed at the distances of 0, 10, 25, 50 and 75 m from infested chickpea plots before scheduled irrigation and forecast rainfall events. Trap plants were transferred to a controlled temperature room (20 °C) for 48 h (100% humidity) after being exposed in the field for 2–6 days for rainfall events, and for one day for irrigation events. After 48 h incubation period, trap plants were transferred to a glasshouse (20 °C) to allow lesion development. Lesions on all plant parts were counted after two weeks, which gave an estimate of the number of conidia released and the distance travelled. Trap plants at all distances were infected in all sprinkler irrigation and rainfall events. The highest number of lesions on trap plants were recorded closest to the infested plots – the numbers decreased as the distance from the infested plots increased. There was a positive relationship between the amount of rainfall and the number of lesions recorded on trap plants. A generalised additive model was developed that efficiently described spatial patterns of conidial spread. With further development, the model can be used to predict the spread of A. rabiei. This is the first systematic study to show that conidia distribute A. rabiei over longer distances than previously reported.


## Reproducibility and data availability

This analysis is packaged and fully reproducible. All data from this work are included in this repository and R package in the "inst/extdata" folder. The code used in the statistical analyses and data visualisation is available to run in R Markdown vignettes, including extra instruction for which I did not have space in the paper. These are also archived and documented with Zenodo,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4563709, for reuse

A user-friendly website of this research compendium is available here, <https://ihsankhaliq.github.io/spatiotemporaldynamics/>.
Interested parties may wish to view the code for visualisation pipeline as well as models fitting. These are available under the "Articles" menu item of the [web page](https://ihsankhaliq.github.io/spatiotemporaldynamics/).
